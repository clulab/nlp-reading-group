The Mystery of In-Context Learning: A Comprehensive Survey on Interpretation and Analysis
Mihai: Possibly good survey. Need to read paper.

Improved Learned Sparse Retrieval with Entity Vocabulary
Mihai: Learned sparse retrieval has potential due to the much better interpretability!

Toward Robust RALMs: Revealing the Impact of Imperfect Retrieval on Retrieval-Augmented Language Models
Mihai: Discusses limitations of RAG approaches. Good entry point if working on RAG.

RE-RAG: Improving Open-Domain QA Performance and Interpretability with Relevance Estimator in Retrieval-Augmented Generation
https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05794
Mihai: Identifies which RAG context helps answering questions correctly

QUITE: Quantifying Uncertainty in Natural Language Text in Bayesian Reasoning Scenarios
Mihai: Dataset for probabilistic QA. Includes neuro-symbolic code with ProgLog!
